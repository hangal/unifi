use cases.

1. Existing binaries, no build required, just a bunch of dirs and a set of jars in them.
perl run_unifi.pl -j classes/foo.jar jar_to_check apache-tomcat-5-5-15 apache-tomcat-5-5-14 apache-tomcat 5-5-13 ... -jar 

2. Existing project, get CVS snaps at different dates.
perl run_unifi.pl -j classes/foo.jar jar_to_check -d 20060601,20060501,20060401,20060301,20060201,20060101 dir1 dir2 dir3

3. Nightly diff on the same jars.

(will need -prefix option preferably)
